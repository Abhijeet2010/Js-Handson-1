    </p>

    <pre>
        const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
            return a+b;
        };  
    </pre>

    <h3>2. Find if the conditions are obeyed or not?</h3>
    <p>
        You are given two number first as A & B and check if both conditions (A < 10 and A> B) are satisfied or not with
            the help of operators.
    </p>

    <pre>
    const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {
    if(a<10 && a>b){
      return true
    }else{
      return false
    }
    };
    </pre>

    <h3>3. Check the conditons</h3>
    <p>
        You are given two numbers A & B. You need to do the following checks:
        <br />
        1. if both are divisible by 10 console true. <br />
        2. if both are not divisible by 10 console false. <br />
        3. if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true. <br />
        Use operator to do this.
    </p>

    <pre>
        const Check = (A, B) => 
        {
            if(A%10===0 && B%10===0){
              return true
            }else if(A%10===0 || B%10===0){
              return true
            }else{
              return false
            }
